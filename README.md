# burger
## Overview
  In this project we have an app that lists burgers from a database and allows the user to pick burgers to devour. Once a
  burger is devoured(using the devour button) the page will reload and the burger selected to be devoured will appear in the 
  "devoured" column. Users can also add their own burgers to the list using the "add burger" button. The new burger will be 
  added to the "burgers to be devoured" column.
  
 ### Technologies
  for this project we used a variety of technologies and js frameworks
  *MySQLWorkbench - used to create and store our data in the database titled *burgers_db*
  *MySQL - to connect to the database
  *Jquery - used for our 'on click' listeners, ajax calls, and grabbing the input value from the "add burger" input field
  *Custom ORM- to help simplify our route writing and store some functions
